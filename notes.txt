We can split the program into two phases:
1. Parsing
2. Execution

Parsing:
1. In this phase, we need to ensure that:
	a. The user enters a valid .cub file (No random file types, 
		no incorrect maps, the params at the top of the .cub file must be handled)
	b. Once the .cub file is verified, we can initialize our data structure(s) and move on to
		execution
2. need to finalize how to handle spaces
3. need to ensure all the elements are present in the map  - F C - correct count



Execution:
